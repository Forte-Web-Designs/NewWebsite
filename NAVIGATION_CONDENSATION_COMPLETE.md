# Navigation Bar Condensation - COMPLETE

## Problem Identified
The navigation bar was becoming too wide and messy with 8 main navigation items, making it crowded and harder to use, especially on smaller desktop screens.

## Solution Implemented
Condensed the navigation from 8 main items to 5 main items by strategically reorganizing and combining related functionality.

## Before vs After

2. **Services** (dropdown with 5 items)
3. **Industries** (dropdown with 6 items)
4. **Top Locations** (multi-level dropdown)
5. **Pricing** (dropdown with 2 items)
6. **About Us** (dropdown with 3 items)
7. **Free Website Audit** (single link)
8. **Blog** (single link)

1. **Home** (single link)
2. **Services** (dropdown with 6 items - includes Free Website Audit)
