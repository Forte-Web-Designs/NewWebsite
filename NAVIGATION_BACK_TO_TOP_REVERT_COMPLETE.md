# Navigation & Back-to-Top Revert - Complete

## Overview
Successfully reverted both the navigation bar layout and back-to-top button positioning back to their original configurations as requested.

## âœ… Changes Reverted

### 1. Navigation Bar Layout Restoration
**File:** `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`

**Reverted Changes:**
- **Container Layout**: Restored `justify-between` for proper spread layout
- **Logo Positioning**: Removed `mr-8` margin, restored to standard positioning
- **Navigation Flex**: Removed `flex-1`, restored to standard flex layout
- **Right Side**: Removed `ml-auto`, restored to standard spacing

**Current State (Restored):**
```tsx
<div className="flex items-center justify-between">
  <Link href="/" className="hidden md:flex items-center transition-all duration-300 hover:scale-105 cursor-pointer">
    {/* Logo */}
  </Link>
  <nav className="hidden md:flex items-center space-x-8">
    {/* Navigation items */}
  </nav>
  <nav className="hidden md:flex items-center space-x-4">
    {/* Theme toggle & contact button */}
