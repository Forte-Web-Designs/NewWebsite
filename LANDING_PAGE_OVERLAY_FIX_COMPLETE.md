# Landing Page Mobile Menu Overlay Fix - COMPLETE

## Summary
Fixed the mobile menu overlay hierarchy issue where the main Forte Web Designs site header was appearing on top of the landing page mobile menu. Updated z-index values to ensure proper layering and complete overlay coverage.

## Date: July 24, 2025

## Issue Identified

### ❌ **Problem:**
- **Landing page mobile menu**: Using `z-[55]`
- **Main site header**: Using `z-[999999]` 
- **Result**: Main site hamburger menu (F logo) was visible and clickable above the landing page menu
- **User Experience**: Confusing navigation with competing menu systems

### ✅ **Solution:**
- **Updated landing page mobile menu**: Now using `z-[9999999]`
- **Proper overlay hierarchy**: Landing page menu now sits above everything
- **Clean user experience**: Only the landing page menu is visible when opened

## Technical Implementation

### Z-Index Update:
```tsx
// BEFORE (inadequate):
<div className="fixed inset-0 z-[55] lg:hidden">

// AFTER (proper overlay):
<div className="fixed inset-0 z-[9999999] lg:hidden">
```

### New Z-Index Hierarchy:
```tsx
z-[9999999] - Landing Page Mobile Menu (highest priority)
z-[999999]  - Main Site Header Mobile Menu (below landing page)
z-[100]     - Main Site Header Sticky Navigation
z-50        - Landing Page Sticky Navigation
z-40        - Demo Banner
z-30        - Mobile Sticky CTA
```

## Benefits
