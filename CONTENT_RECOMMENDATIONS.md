# Content Modernization Recommendations

## Analysis: Your Site vs Leading AI Companies

### Current Issues:
1. **Too many emojis** - Makes it look unprofessional/AI-generated
2. **"Growth Snapshot" overused** - Appears 5+ times, feels salesy
3. **4 Service Layers** - Confusing, most companies show 2-3 max
4. **Pricing structure visible** - Leading companies hide pricing for custom work
5. **Small social proof** - "25+ businesses" highlights being small
6. **Too much text** - Paragraphs are too long

### What Leading Companies Do:

#### **OpenAI (openai.com)**
- Hero: "Creating safe AGI that benefits all of humanity"
- 3 products clearly shown
- "Contact Sales" for enterprise
- No visible pricing for custom work
- Clean, minimal design

#### **Anthropic (anthropic.com)**
- Hero: "AI research and products that put safety at the frontier"
- 2-3 key features
- Simple "Talk to Sales" CTA
- Focus on capabilities, not process
- Extremely clean design

#### **Linear (linear.app)**
- Hero: "The issue tracking tool you'll enjoy using"
- Product screenshots prominently displayed
- Clean pricing tiers (simple 3-tier)
- Minimal text, maximum visual

#### **Stripe (stripe.com)**
- Hero: "Financial infrastructure for the internet"
- Clear product categories
- "Contact Sales" for complex needs
- Trust through logos (not numbers)

## Recommendations for Forte Web Designs:

### 1. **Remove All Emojis**
- Replace with icons or just remove entirely
- Use typography/color for emphasis

### 2. **Simplify Hero Message**
HOME PAGE:
```
Current: "Business Growth Isn't Guesswork. It's [rotating words]"
Better:  "AI-powered systems that scale your business"
         or
         "Turn your website into a growth engine"
```

### 3. **Reduce Service Layers (4 → 2)**
**Current:**
1. Website Design (Foundation)
2. Smart Automation (Growth)
3. Systems Integration (Scaling)
4. End-to-End System

**Better (like Anthropic/OpenAI):**
1. **Website & Automation** - Complete system that captures and converts leads
2. **Enterprise Solutions** - Custom integrations and AI implementation

### 4. **Pricing Page Recommendations**

**Option A: Hide Complex Pricing** (Recommended for custom work)
```
Three tiers:
- Starter ($3-5K) - Website + Basic Automation
- Professional ($7-15K) - Full System
- Enterprise - Custom (Contact Sales)
```

**Option B: Remove Pricing Page Entirely**
- Replace with "Talk to Us" everywhere
- Pricing determined in consultation
- Like Anthropic/OpenAI approach

### 5. **Replace "Growth Snapshot" Language**

**Current:** "Get My Free Growth Snapshot"
**Better:**
- "Talk to Our Team"
- "Book a Consultation"
- "Get Started"
- "Contact Sales"

### 6. **Simplify Copy (Remove Fluff)**

**Current About Page:**
"Forte Web Designs started as a custom web design agency in Grapevine, Texas. Today, we've evolved into a Business Growth Systems Partner — helping service-based businesses nationwide capture more leads, book more appointments, and scale operations with predictable, measurable results."

**Better (Anthropic-style):**
"We build AI-powered systems that help businesses scale. Based in DFW, serving nationwide."

### 7. **Social Proof Strategy**

**Don't highlight:**
- "25+ businesses" (too small)
- "4.9 stars" (every agency says this)

**Do highlight:**
- Client logos (if you have recognizable ones)
- Specific outcomes: "2x lead conversion" not "growing with Forte"
- Technical credibility: "Certified Airtable, Pipedrive"

### 8. **Navigation Simplification**

**Current:** Home, Services (dropdown), About, Pricing, Blog
**Better:** Products, Solutions, Pricing, Company, Contact

- Clear, concise, technical credibility
- "Here's what we build"
- Capabilities and outcomes
- Simple: "This is what you get"

## Competitive Positioning:

**Stop competing with:** Local web agencies

basic tools but aren't ready for enterprise software."
