## Customization

You can customize the website by modifying:

- **Colors**: Edit the color palette in `tailwind.config.js`
- **Content**: Update page content in the respective files under `/src/app`
- **Components**: Modify or add components in the `/src/components` directory
- **Styles**: Adjust global styles in `/src/app/globals.css`

## Development Best Practices

### üé® Theme Management

- **Global Theme Colors**: Always use the color variables defined in `tailwind.config.js` instead of hardcoded values
- **Theme Provider**: All theme state is managed through `ThemeProvider` in `/src/app/providers/ThemeProvider.tsx`
- **Dark/Light Variants**: Use Tailwind's dark mode variant (`dark:bg-gray-900`) in combination with the theme provider
- **Theme Toggle**: Include the `ThemeToggle` component in relevant layouts to allow users to switch themes
- **Consistency**: Follow the established color patterns - primary colors for main actions, secondary for accents, grays for UI elements

```jsx
// Example of proper theme usage
<div className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">
  <button className="bg-primary-600 hover:bg-primary-700 dark:bg-primary-500">
    Action Button
  </button>
</div>
```

### üñºÔ∏è Image Optimization

The project includes three specialized image components that should be used consistently:

1. **OptimizedImage**: `/src/components/images/OptimizedImage.tsx`
   - Use for standard content images
   - Always provide descriptive `alt` text
   - Set `priority` to `true` for above-the-fold images
   - Width and height should maintain the image's aspect ratio

2. **BackgroundImage**: `/src/components/images/BackgroundImage.tsx`
   - Use for hero sections and call-to-action backgrounds
   - Always include an appropriate overlay for text readability
   - Works best with 16:9 or 21:9 aspect ratio images

3. **Icon**: `/src/components/images/Icon.tsx`
   - Use for all SVG icons throughout the site
   - Place SVG files in `/public/images/shared/icons/`

```jsx
// Example usage
import { OptimizedImage } from '@/components/images/OptimizedImage';
import { BackgroundImage } from '@/components/images/BackgroundImage';
import { Icon } from '@/components/images/Icon';

// Content image
<OptimizedImage
  src="/images/page/image.jpg"
  width={800}
  height={600}
  alt="Descriptive text"
  priority={isAboveTheFold}
/>

// Background with content
<BackgroundImage
  src="/images/page/banner.jpg"
  alt="Banner description"
  overlayClassName="bg-primary-900/70"
>
  <h2>Content goes here</h2>
</BackgroundImage>

// Icon
<Icon name="check" className="w-5 h-5" />
```

### üöÄ Performance Optimization

- **Client Components**: Mark components with `'use client'` only when necessary (event handlers, hooks)
- **Link Prefetching**: Always use `prefetch={true}` for main navigation links
- **Image Loading**: Use `priority` for above-the-fold images, lazy loading is automatic for others
- **Component Splitting**: Split large components into smaller, focused ones
- **Bundle Size**: Monitor bundle size and avoid unnecessary dependencies
- **Server Components**: Use server components by default for better performance

```jsx
// Example of proper Link usage with prefetching
import Link from 'next/link';

<Link href="/about" prefetch={true}>
  About Us
</Link>
```

### üì± SEO Best Practices

For each new page:

1. **Metadata**: Always define page-specific metadata:
   ```tsx
   export const metadata: Metadata = {
     title: 'Page Title', // Will be formatted as "Page Title | Forte"
     description: 'Concise, compelling description under 155 characters',
   };
   ```

2. **Semantic HTML**: Use appropriate HTML elements (`<h1>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, etc.)
3. **Heading Structure**: Follow proper hierarchy (one `<h1>` per page, followed by `<h2>`, then `<h3>`, etc.)
4. **Alt Text**: Provide descriptive alt text for all images
5. **Structured Data**: Add JSON-LD structured data when appropriate for rich snippets

### üåê Accessibility

- **Color Contrast**: Ensure text has sufficient contrast against backgrounds (at least 4.5:1 for normal text)
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Make sure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- **ARIA Attributes**: Add appropriate ARIA roles and attributes when necessary
- **Focus Indicators**: Maintain visible focus indicators for keyboard users

## Page Creation Checklist

When creating a new page:

- [ ] Add proper metadata (title, description)
- [ ] Use semantic HTML structure
- [ ] Implement proper heading hierarchy
- [ ] Use OptimizedImage component for all images with alt text
- [ ] Add appropriate prefetch to all internal navigation links
- [ ] Test in both light and dark theme
- [ ] Check responsive behavior on different screen sizes
- [ ] Ensure accessible color contrast and keyboard navigation
- [ ] Verify proper Tailwind classes and theme consistency

By following these guidelines consistently, your project will maintain high performance, accessibility, and SEO standards while providing a seamless user experience.
