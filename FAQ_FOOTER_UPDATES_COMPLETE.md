Q: What's included in Forte Care™?
A: Forte Care™ includes unlimited website edits (content, images, pages, design tweaks), 24/7 security monitoring, performance optimization, automated backups, uptime monitoring, and priority technical support. The key value-add is unlimited edits – need to add a new service page, update your hours, or refresh your content? It's all included with no extra fees. Think of it as having your own dedicated web team on retainer.
