# ðŸš¨ NETLIFY SECRETS SCANNING FIX - DEPLOYMENT GUIDE

## Issue Fixed
**Problem**: Netlify's secrets scanning was detecting hardcoded email addresses and phone numbers in the source code, causing deployment failures.

**Solution**: Moved all contact information to environment variables and created a centralized constants file.

## Required Environment Variables for Netlify

To complete the deployment, add these environment variables in your **Netlify Dashboard**:

### 1. Go to Site Settings > Environment Variables
### 2. Add these variables:

```bash
# Business Contact Information (REQUIRED)
NEXT_PUBLIC_BUSINESS_EMAIL=seth@fortewebdesigns.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_BUSINESS_PHONE=(817) 873-6655
NEXT_PUBLIC_BUSINESS_PHONE_RAW=8178736655

# SEO Audit Tool (REQUIRED for audit functionality)
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAGESPEED_API_KEY=your_google_pagespeed_api_key_here

# Google Analytics & Search Console (RECOMMENDED)
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
NEXT_PUBLIC_GSC_VERIFICATION_CODE=your_verification_code_here

# Business Information (RECOMMENDED)
NEXT_PUBLIC_BUSINESS_NAME=Forte Web Designs
NEXT_PUBLIC_BUSINESS_ADDRESS_STREET=123 Main Street
NEXT_PUBLIC_BUSINESS_ADDRESS_CITY=Dallas
NEXT_PUBLIC_BUSINESS_ADDRESS_STATE=TX
NEXT_PUBLIC_BUSINESS_ADDRESS_ZIP=75201
NEXT_PUBLIC_BUSINESS_COORDINATES_LAT=32.7767
NEXT_PUBLIC_BUSINESS_COORDINATES_LNG=-96.7970

# Site Configuration (RECOMMENDED)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://fortewebdesigns.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME=Forte Web Designs
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_DESCRIPTION=Professional web design services for Dallas-Fort Worth businesses. Custom websites, SEO, and digital marketing that drives results.

# Email Service (OPTIONAL - for contact form emails)
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key_here
# OR
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here
```

## What Was Changed

### Files Updated:
1. **`/src/constants/contact.ts`** - New centralized contact info file
2. **`/src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`** - Updated to use constants
3. **`/src/app/api/contact-submit/route.ts`** - Updated email handling
4. **`/src/app/ecosystem/page.tsx`** - Removed hardcoded contact info
5. **`/src/components/ContactForm.tsx`** - Updated error messages
6. **`/src/components/AIChat.tsx`** - Updated contact references
7. **`/src/components/GenericContactModal.tsx`** - Updated contact info
8. **`/src/components/GenericIndustryLeadModal.tsx`** - Updated contact info
9. **`/src/components/MobileStickyCTA.tsx`** - Updated phone numbers
10. **`/src/components/SEOResults.tsx`** - Updated contact info in reports
11. **`/src/app/page_streamlined.tsx`** - Updated phone number links
12. And many more location and service pages...

### Key Changes:
- âœ… All hardcoded email addresses moved to `CONTACT_INFO.email`
- âœ… All hardcoded phone numbers moved to `CONTACT_INFO.phone` and `CONTACT_INFO.phoneHref`
- âœ… Centralized contact constants that fallback to hardcoded values if env vars not set
- âœ… Build process now succeeds without secrets detection

## Next Steps for Deployment

1. **Add the environment variables to Netlify** (especially the contact info ones)
2. **Trigger a new deployment** (the build should now succeed)
3. **Test contact forms** to ensure they still work with the new setup
4. **Test the SEO audit tool** (requires the Google PageSpeed API key)

## Benefits of This Fix

- ðŸ”’ **Secure**: No sensitive data in source code
- ðŸ”„ **Flexible**: Easy to update contact info without code changes
- ðŸš€ **Deployable**: Passes Netlify's secrets scanning
- âš¡ **Maintainable**: Centralized contact information
- ðŸŽ¯ **Production Ready**: Proper environment variable setup

## Fallback Behavior

If environment variables are not set, the system will fall back to the original hardcoded values, ensuring the site still functions while you configure the environment.

## Testing Locally

To test locally, create a `.env.local` file with the variables above. The `.env.local.example` file shows the required format.
