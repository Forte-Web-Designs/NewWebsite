# Device Preview Section Implementation - COMPLETE ✅

## Overview
Successfully implemented realistic device previews on the Plumber Industry page (`/industries/plumbers`) showing how emergency CTA content appears on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Implementation Details

### 📍 Location
Replaced the previous "🚨 RAPID PLUMBING PROS" section in the hero area of the plumber page, positioned directly under the hero content and before the "Why We're Plumbing Website Experts" section.

### 🎯 Goal Achieved
Shows plumbers what their emergency CTA could look like on both **desktop and mobile**, but **inside actual device mockups** to clearly communicate these are previews — not live content.

## Design Features

### 🖥️ Desktop Preview
- **MacBook-style Frame**: Dark silver/charcoal laptop frame with shadow
- **Content Layout**: 
  - Compact header with "RAPID PLUMBING PROS" branding
  - Two-column services grid (Drain Cleaning $89+, Water Heater $150+)
  - Emergency call button with phone number
- **Responsive Design**: Scales appropriately on different screen sizes
- **Visual Note**: "This is a preview of your emergency section"

### 📱 Mobile Preview

- 🔥 Water Heater Repair – $150+
- 🆘 Emergency Service – CALL NOW!
- 📞 (555) 123-PLUMBER
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 4.9/5 Stars
- ✅ Licensed & Insured

## Technical Implementation

### Code Structure

- **Mobile Device**: Phone frame with realistic proportions (9:19.5 aspect ratio)

- **Animation**: Integrated with existing SimpleScrollReveal animations

### Key CSS Classes Used
- `aspect-ratio` for device screen proportions
- `bg-gradient-to-*` for device frame styling
- `rounded-*` for realistic device corners
- `shadow-*` for depth and realism
- Responsive breakpoints (`lg:flex-row`, `max-w-*`)
