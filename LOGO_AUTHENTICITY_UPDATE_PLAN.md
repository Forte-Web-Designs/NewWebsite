I need to update ALL remaining industry logos to follow the authentic variety pattern. This includes:

## Authentic Logo Variety Patterns:

### Pattern 1: Text-only wordmark (like IBM, Google, Ford)
- Clean typography
- Company name only
- Optional underline

### Pattern 2: Icon-only monogram (like Nike swoosh, Apple, BMW)
- Simple geometric shapes
- Initials or symbols
- Minimal design

### Pattern 3: Corporate rectangular (like Microsoft, Walmart)
- Rectangular background
- Text overlay
- Professional appearance

### Pattern 4: Badge/emblem (like Harley Davidson, fire dept)
- Shield or circular shapes
- Official/authority appearance
- Detailed but not complex

### Pattern 5: Simple geometric (like Target, Chase, AT&T)
- Basic shapes
- Clean lines
- Modern appearance

## Industries to Update:
1. ✅ HVAC - DONE
2. ✅ Restaurant - DONE  
3. ✅ Plumbing - DONE (already completed)
4. 🔄 Landscaping - IN PROGRESS
5. ❌ Handyman - TODO
6. ❌ Painters - TODO
7. ❌ Construction - TODO
8. ❌ Healthcare - TODO
9. ❌ Electricians - TODO

This will ensure all 45+ logos across all industries have authentic variety rather than looking AI-generated.
