## 📈 Expected Questions & Responses

### "Do I need the SEO package if I already have Built-in SEO?"
**Response**: "The built-in SEO gives you a solid foundation – better than template sites. But the Forte SEO™ package is what actively grows your rankings over time through ongoing optimization, content creation, and link building. It's the difference between being functional on Google and actually climbing to the top positions."

### "Can I add the SEO package later?"
**Response**: "Absolutely! Many clients start with just the website to establish their online presence, then add the SEO package when they're ready to focus on growth. Your site will already have the technical foundations in place, making it easier to build on when you're ready."

### "How long until I see results?"
**Response**: "With just the built-in SEO, your site will be technically sound from day one, which is already better than many competitors. With the Forte SEO™ package, most local businesses see noticeable improvements in 90 days, with significant growth in 4-6 months as we build authority and content."
