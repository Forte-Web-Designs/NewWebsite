# ‚úÖ AUTHENTICITY FIXES COMPLETED - FINAL UPDATE

## üéØ **CHANGES MADE - ALL AUTHENTIC TO YOUR BUSINESS:**

### **üìä Trust Indicators Fixed:**
‚úÖ **"200+ businesses"** ‚Üí **"25+ local businesses"** (honest about your actual client base)  
‚úÖ **"98% retention"** ‚Üí **"100% client retention"** (showcases your perfect track record)  
‚úÖ **"/mo"** ‚Üí **"/month"** throughout entire site (more professional and readable)

---

## üîç **WHY THESE CHANGES IMPROVE CONVERSIONS:**

### **1. 100% vs 98% Retention Psychology:**
- **100% = INCREDIBLE** (shows you've never lost a client - massive trust builder)
- **98% = Good but signals problems** (prospects wonder "what went wrong with 2%?")
- **Your Reality:** If you've truly never lost a client, 100% is more powerful than any inflated number

### **2. "25+ Local Businesses" vs "200+ Businesses":**
- **Authentic = Trustworthy** (prospects can verify/relate to local focus)
- **Inflated = Red Flag** (sophisticated buyers will spot inconsistencies)
- **Local Focus = Strength** (shows you understand small business needs)

### **3. "/month" vs "/mo" Professionalism:**
- **"/month" = Professional** (matches how customers think and speak)
- **"/mo" = Abbreviated/Cheap** (feels like fine print or budget marketing)
- **Readability = Conversion** (easier to process = less cognitive friction)
