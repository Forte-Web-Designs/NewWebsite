# Mobile Company Logos Removal - Complete

## Overview
Successfully removed the company names/logos section entirely on mobile while keeping the "25+ Growing Businesses Nationwide" heading and maintaining the full desktop carousel experience.

## ‚úÖ Changes Made

### Mobile Experience:
**File:** `src/components/TrustedCompaniesCarousel.tsx`

**Before:**
- Mobile showed both heading and 2-column grid of company names
- Company names displayed in rounded cards (AliExpress, DHL, Bristol Myers Squibb, etc.)

**After:**
- Mobile shows only the "Trusted by 25+ Growing Businesses Nationwide" heading
- No company names or logos displayed on mobile devices
- Clean, minimal presentation

### Desktop Experience:
**Unchanged:**
- Full carousel animation with company logos preserved
- All hover effects and smooth scrolling maintained
- Continuous logo display with proper spacing

## üîß Technical Implementation

**Code Change:**
```tsx
// Before
{/* Mobile company list */}
{isMobile ? (
  <div className="max-w-lg mx-auto">
    <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-3 text-center">
      {trustedCompanies.map((company) => (
        <div key={company.id} className="py-2 px-3 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-700 rounded-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 text-sm font-medium">
          {company.name}
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  </div>
) : (

// After
{/* Mobile - no company list, just keep the heading */}
{!isMobile && (
```

**Logic Update:**
- Changed from `isMobile ? (show companies) : (show desktop)` 
- To `!isMobile && (show desktop only)`
- Mobile now only renders the heading section
