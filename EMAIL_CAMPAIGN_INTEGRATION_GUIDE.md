## ðŸ“Š Email Campaign Examples

### Campaign 1: Cold Outreach

**Subject:** "Custom Website for [Business Name] - See Demo"

**Email Content:**
```html
Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Business Name] doesn't have a strong online presence in [City].

Most plumbing businesses lose 60% of potential customers because they can't be found online.

I've created a custom website mockup specifically for [Business Name] that shows how we can help you:

âœ… Get found on Google for "[City] plumber"
âœ… Convert more website visitors into paying customers
âœ… Look more professional than your competition

### Campaign 2: Follow-up Sequence

**Email 1 - Day 0:** Introduction + Landing Page
**Email 2 - Day 3:** Case study from similar business
**Email 3 - Day 7:** Limited time offer
**Email 4 - Day 14:** Final follow-up

### Campaign 3: Segmented by Location

Create separate campaigns for different cities with location-specific messaging:
- Dallas plumbers
- Fort Worth plumbers
- Austin plumbers

## ðŸ”§ Technical Setup

### 1. Email Service Configuration

Add to your `.env.local` file:
```bash
# Email service (choose one)
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_api_key
ZAPIER_WEBHOOK_URL=your_webhook_url
MAKE_WEBHOOK_URL=your_webhook_url

# Analytics
GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
GOOGLE_ADS_CONVERSION_ID=AW-XXXXXXXXX
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install @sendgrid/mail
# OR
npm install resend
```

### 3. Set Up Form Handling

The contact form automatically captures:
- Lead information
- Landing page context
- UTM parameters
- Timestamp and user data

## ðŸ“ˆ Analytics & Tracking

### 1. Google Analytics Events

Track these events automatically:
```javascript
// Landing page view
gtag('event', 'page_view', {
  'business_name': params.business,
  'utm_source': params.utm_source,
  'utm_campaign': params.utm_campaign
});

// Form submission
gtag('event', 'conversion', {
  'send_to': 'AW-CONVERSION_ID/CONVERSION_LABEL',
  'business_name': params.business
});
```

### 2. Email Platform Tracking

**Track these metrics:**
- Email open rate
- Click-through rate to landing page
- Landing page conversion rate
- Form submission rate
- Phone call conversions

### 3. UTM Parameter Setup

Always include these UTM parameters:
- `utm_source`: email platform (mailchimp, convertkit, etc.)
- `utm_medium`: email
- `utm_campaign`: campaign name (plumbing_outreach, cold_email_1, etc.)

### Template 2: Text-based (Higher Deliverability)

```
Hi {{first_name}},

I was looking at plumbing businesses in {{city}} and noticed {{business}} could use a better online presence.

Here's the thing - 87% of customers search for "plumber near me" on Google before calling anyone.

If {{business}} isn't showing up, you're losing customers to competitors every day.

I've put together a custom website demo specifically for {{business}} that shows how we can help you:

â†’ Get found on Google for "{{city}} plumber"
â†’ Convert more visitors into paying customers  
â†’ Look more professional than competitors

See your custom demo here:
{{landing_page_url}}

No upfront costs, cancel anytime.

Best,
Seth

P.S. - This demo is specifically for {{business}} and includes your actual business information.
