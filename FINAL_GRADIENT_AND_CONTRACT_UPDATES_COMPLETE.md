## ✅ **Task 2: Plumbing Gradient Color Scheme - COMPLETE**

### **Issue Identified:**
The plumbing industry page was excluded from previous gradient color scheme updates and needed a dynamic gradient to match other industry pages.

### **New Plumbing Color Scheme Implemented:**
- **Primary Gradient:** `from-blue-600 via-cyan-600 to-blue-700` 
- **Industry Appropriateness:** Blue-to-cyan represents water flow, pipes, and professional plumbing services
- **Badge Colors:** `bg-blue-600/50 text-blue-200`
- **Accent Colors:** `text-cyan-300`, `text-cyan-100`, `text-cyan-600`
- **Mockup Updates:** `from-blue-600 to-cyan-600` header gradient
- **Button Updates:** `text-cyan-700` with appropriate hover states

### **Specific Updates Made:**
1. **Hero Section Gradient:** Updated from solid blue to dynamic blue-cyan gradient
2. **Mockup Header:** Changed from red-orange to blue-cyan gradient  
3. **Company Name:** Updated to "RAPID PLUMBING PROS" with water emojis
4. **All Accent Colors:** Switched from blue to cyan variants
5. **CTA Section:** Updated final gradient to match new theme
6. **Button Implementations:** Fixed visibility issues by replacing DarkButton/LightButton with standard Link components

---

## ✅ **Task 3: Button Visibility Fix - COMPLETE**

### **Issue Identified:**
Text was invisible on plumber website buttons due to conflicting styles between DarkButton component's hardcoded styling and custom className overrides.

### **Solution Implemented:**
- **Removed:** Complex DarkButton/LightButton components that had conflicting styles
- **Replaced:** With standard Next.js Link components using proper Tailwind classes
- **Result:** Clear, visible button text with proper contrast and hover effects

### **Button Examples Fixed:**
```jsx
// Before (Invisible text)
<DarkButton href="/contact?industry=plumbing" className="bg-white text-cyan-700 hover:bg-gray-100">
  Get My Plumber Website Quote
</DarkButton>

// After (Visible text)
<Link 
  href="/contact?industry=plumbing"
  className="bg-white text-cyan-700 font-bold py-4 px-8 rounded-lg hover:bg-gray-100 transition-colors text-center shadow-lg"
>
  Get My Plumber Website Quote
