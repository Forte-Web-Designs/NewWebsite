                  Most people think they're paying for expertise. For the solution. For someone who knows how to build the thing.

                <p>

                  They're trying to squeeze every dollar out of a single project. They think you're paying them for the technical work: for building things, for clicking buttons. They're optimizing for the transaction, not the relationship.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Even if we're only working together on a one-off project, I'm thinking strategically: what actually makes sense for where your business is headed, what sets you up for success long-term, not just what checks a box today. And if we work together multiple times? That's when the real compounding value happens.
                </p>
              </SimpleScrollReveal>

              <SimpleScrollReveal direction="up" delay={600}>
                <p>
                  I'm always taking the time to understand how your business actually works. I'm spotting the opportunities you're missing because you're too deep in the day-to-day. I'm invested in your actual success, not just completing a task and moving on.

                  The technical solution isn't the value. Understanding your business is.

              <SimpleScrollReveal direction="up" delay={700}>
                <p>
                  That's the value. Pinpointing the actual ROI. Understanding the pain points that are costing you time and money every single day. Understanding where you're actually trying to go, not just what you think you need built.
                </p>

              <SimpleScrollReveal direction="up" delay={750}>
                <p>
                  That's exactly why every proposal I send includes a full project plan: the gotchas, the inevitable forks in the road we could face, the hidden costs, the things you probably haven't considered, a complete solution outline. All free, no contract required.

                <p>
                  The value is the partnership. The consistency. The long-term thinking. Someone who shows up and actually cares if the solution works after they're gone.
                </p>
              </SimpleScrollReveal>

                <p>
                  It really comes down to this: You don't build a business on transactions. You build it on relationships. And relationships? They're built on transparency, trust, and being genuinely invested in someone else's success.
