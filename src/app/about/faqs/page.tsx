      question: "How much does a website cost? (Most important question first!) üí∞",
      answer:
        "I love that you're asking this upfront! We have three clear pricing paths: Forte Essential‚Ñ¢ starts at $2,000 (perfect for getting online fast), Forte Growth‚Ñ¢ is $200/month with $0 down (our most popular - includes everything plus ongoing care), and Forte Pro‚Ñ¢ at $5,000 (for businesses serious about dominating their market). The real question is: how much is staying invisible to potential customers costing you right now?",
    },
    {
      question: "How long will my website take to build? ‚è∞",
      answer:
        "Here's what's exciting - you'll see your design in the first week! Most websites are live in 4-6 weeks. But here's the thing: every day you wait is another day your competitors are capturing the customers who should be calling you. The sooner we start, the sooner you're making money from your new site. Ready to get started?",
    },
    {
      question: "What if I don't love the design? üò¨",
      answer:
        "Honestly? This never happens with our process, but if it did, we'd fix it completely free. We include unlimited design revisions because I'd rather do it right than do it fast. In 4+ years, we've never had a client who wasn't excited to show off their new site. That's not luck - it's our process working!",
    },
  ],
  "Plans & Pricing": [
    {
      question: "What's included with Forte Growth‚Ñ¢ at $200/month? üì¶",
      answer: "Everything! 5-page custom site, hosting, domain, lifetime support, and Forte Care‚Ñ¢ (unlimited edits). No hidden fees, no surprises. Most businesses spend more than this on coffee each month, but this actually grows your revenue. It's like having a full marketing team for less than hiring one employee.",
    },
    {
      question: "Why is Forte Essential‚Ñ¢ $2,000 when I can get a template for $100? ü§î",
      answer:
        "Great question! That $100 template will cost you thousands in lost customers because it loads slowly, looks generic, and doesn't convert visitors. Our clients typically see their investment returned within 60 days through new business. Would you rather save $1,900 upfront or make an extra $10,000+ this year?",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I upgrade as my business grows? üìà",
      answer:
        "Absolutely! And here's the best part - when you're ready to upgrade, we credit everything you've already invested. It's like we're betting on your success. Start where you're comfortable, then scale as your business grows. Your website should fuel your growth, not limit it.",
    },
  ],
  "Forte Care‚Ñ¢ Support": [
    {
      question: "What exactly is Forte Care‚Ñ¢? üõ†Ô∏è",
      answer:
        "Think of it as insurance for your most important marketing asset. We monitor your site 24/7, make unlimited updates, handle all technical issues, and continuously optimize for better results. Most importantly: when your website makes you money, you call it. When it breaks, we fix it. While you sleep, we're making sure your site is working for you.",
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if my website breaks? üò±",
      answer:
        "With Forte Care‚Ñ¢, we typically fix issues before you even know they exist. But if something does happen, we guarantee a response within 2 hours. Compare that to hiring a freelancer who might take days to get back to you. Every minute your site is down, you're losing money.",
    },
    {
      question: "Why should I pay for ongoing care vs. just fixing things when they break? üí°",
      answer:
        "Because prevention is always cheaper than emergency repair! Our Forte Care‚Ñ¢ clients have 99.9% uptime and their sites get faster and better performing over time. The real question: can you afford for your website to be down when your biggest opportunity walks through the door?",
    },
  ],
  "Website & Tech": [
    {
      question: "Will my website work on phones? üì±",
      answer:
        "Not just work - it'll shine! 60%+ of your customers will find you on mobile, so we design mobile-first. Every site gets tested on dozens of devices. Your mobile site won't just look good, it'll convert visitors into customers better than most desktop sites. Mobile-friendly isn't enough anymore - you need mobile-optimized.",
    },
    {
      question: "How fast will my website be? ‚ö°",
      answer:
        "Lightning fast! Our sites load in under 2 seconds-so visitors stay, engage, and convert faster. Why does this matter? Every second your site takes to load costs you 7% of potential customers. Our speed optimization has helped clients increase conversions by 40%+. Fast sites don't just feel better - they make more money.",
    },
    {
      question: "What makes your websites different from everyone else's? üî•",
      answer:
        "Three words: Hand. Coded. Performance. No WordPress, no page builders, no bloated templates. Just clean, custom code that loads instantly and converts like crazy. Plus, you get a real human who answers the phone, not a ticket system. When was the last time your current web company actually called you back?",
    },
  ],
  "SEO & Marketing": [
    {
      question: "Will people be able to find my website on Google? üéØ",
      answer:
        "That's the whole point! Every site is built SEO-ready from day one. Our clients typically see 50-200% increases in Google visibility within 3-6 months. But here's what's really exciting: we can also manage your Google Ads and social media to get you found even faster. Imagine having customers find you while you sleep!",
    },
    {
      question: "How quickly will I see results? üìä",
      answer:
        "Week 1: Your new site is converting visitors better. Month 1: You're seeing more inquiries. Month 3-6: Google starts ranking you higher. Month 12: You're wondering why you waited so long! The sooner you start, the sooner you're ahead of competitors who are still 'thinking about it.'",
    },
    {
      question: "Why should I choose Forte Web Designs over the hundreds of other options? üèÜ",
      answer:
        "Because we're not just building websites - we're building your business growth engine. Our clients don't just get a website, they get a competitive advantage. We've helped businesses increase their revenue by 200-500% within the first year. The real question isn't why choose us - it's how much longer can you afford to wait?",
