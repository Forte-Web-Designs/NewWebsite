# HVAC & Electrician Industry Page Optimizations Complete

## Issues Fixed

### ✅ **Table Icon Visibility Problem**
- **Problem**: Comparison table icons (check/x) were not visible or appearing as black/grey in both light and dark modes
- **Root Cause**: Using Next.js `Image` component for SVGs which doesn't support `currentColor` styling
- **Solution**: 
  - Created new `InlineSVG.tsx` component for theme-aware icons
  - Replaced `Icon` components with `InlineSVG` in comparison tables
  - Added proper flex centering for consistent alignment

### ✅ **Button Visibility Issues**
- **Problem**: "Get My HVAC Website" and "Get My Electrician Website" buttons had poor contrast
- **Root Cause**: Using complex button components with inconsistent styling
- **Solution**:
  - Replaced `DarkButton` and `LightButton` components with direct `Link` components
  - Enhanced contrast with darker text colors (`text-orange-700`, `text-yellow-700`)
  - Added `font-bold` and `shadow-lg` for better visibility
  - Ensured consistent hover states

### ✅ **Light/Dark Mode Text Visibility**
- **Problem**: Potential text visibility issues across different theme modes
- **Solution**: Verified all text uses proper dark mode classes:
  - Headers: `text-gray-900 dark:text-white`
  - Body text: `text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400` 
  - Accent text: Proper brand colors with dark variants
