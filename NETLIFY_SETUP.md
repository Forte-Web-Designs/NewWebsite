# Netlify Deployment Checklist for Forte Web Designs

## âœ… What's Already Set Up:
- [x] Contact form configured for Netlify Forms
- [x] Form validation and error handling
- [x] Success/Error message display
- [x] Custom thank-you page (`/thank-you`)
- [x] Netlify configuration file (`netlify.toml`) - FIXED syntax errors
- [x] Anti-spam protection (honeypot)
- [x] Build process optimized

## ðŸš€ Next Steps for Deployment:

### 1. Push to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Netlify form integration with fixed config"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Deploy to Netlify
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) and log in
2. Click "New site from Git"
3. Connect your GitHub account
4. Select your repository
5. Build settings should auto-detect:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `.next`
6. Click "Deploy site"

### 3. Configure Email Notifications (CRITICAL - Must do after deployment!)
After your site deploys successfully:

1. **Go to Netlify Dashboard**
2. **Click on your site**
3. **Go to Forms tab**
4. **Click on "Form notifications"**
5. **Click "Add notification"**
6. **Configure as follows:**
   - **Event to listen for**: New form submission
   - **Type**: Email notification
   - **Email to notify**: `seth@fortewebdesigns.com`
   - **Subject**: `New Contact Form Submission - Forte Web Designs`
   - **Custom subject (optional)**: `New inquiry from {{name}} - {{service}}`

### 4. Test the Form
1. Visit your live site: `your-site-name.netlify.app/contact`
2. Fill out the contact form completely
3. Submit the form
4. Look for green success message
5. Check seth@fortewebdesigns.com for the notification email
6. Check spam folder if not received

## ðŸ“§ What Seth Will Receive:
When someone submits the form, you'll get an email with:
- Customer name
- Email address  
- Phone number
- Company name
- Selected service
- Message content
- Submission timestamp

## ðŸŽ¯ Form Features Now Include:
- âœ… **Visual Success Feedback**: Green success message with checkmark
- âœ… **Error Handling**: Red error message if submission fails
- âœ… **Auto-clearing**: Success message disappears after 5 seconds
- âœ… **Form Reset**: Form clears automatically after successful submission
- âœ… **Contact Backup**: Error message includes your direct email
- âœ… **Professional Design**: Messages match your site's styling

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting:
If forms don't work after deployment:
1. **Check Build Logs**: Look for any build errors in Netlify
2. **Verify Form Detection**: Form should appear in Netlify Dashboard under "Forms"
3. **Test Email Setup**: Submit test form and check spam folder
4. **Check Form Name**: Ensure form name="contact" is consistent

## âš¡ Next.js + Netlify Notes:
- Forms work with static export
- Next.js 15 compatibility confirmed
- Build optimizations included

## ðŸ“ž Support:
- Form configured for immediate use after Netlify deployment
- Email notifications require manual setup in Netlify dashboard
