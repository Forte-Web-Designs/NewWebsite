# Mobile Header Optimization - COMPLETE ✅

## 🎯 Task Completed
Successfully removed the first instance of the header on mobile while preserving the header with the "Get Quote" button functionality.

## ⚡ Problem Addressed
The plumbing landing page had **two header instances on mobile**:
1. **First Header**: Mobile-only navigation (`lg:hidden`) with business name and menu toggle
2. **Second Header**: Main navigation header with "Get Quote" button (always visible)

This created redundancy and took up unnecessary screen space on mobile devices.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### **Header Structure Optimization**
- **❌ Removed**: First mobile-only header section (lines 202-308)
- **✅ Kept**: Main navigation header with "Get Quote" functionality
- **✅ Enhanced**: Added mobile menu functionality to the main header

### **Mobile Navigation Consolidation**
- **Mobile Menu Button**: Now integrated into the main header
- **Expandable Content**: Color theme picker and navigation links preserved
- **CTA Functionality**: "Get Quote" button remains prominent and accessible
